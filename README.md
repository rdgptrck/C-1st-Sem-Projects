**C Projects - 1st Year, 1st Semester**

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains C programming projects and exercises I worked on during my first year, first semester in Uni. 
These projects cover fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques in C.

**About**
These projects were developed as part of my coursework in BS Computer Science. They demonstrate my learning 
progress in C programming, including variables, conditionals, functions, loops, arrays, and file handling.

**Projects**
Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Area and Perimeter Calculator for a Circle** - Calculates the area and perimeter of a circle based on user input.
2. **User and Password Log In** - A basic user authentication system requiring correct username and password.
3. **Days to Months, Weeks, Days Converter** - Converts a given number of days into months, weeks, and days.
4. **GWA Calculator** - Computes the General Weighted Average (GWA) based on inputted grades.
5. **Dynamic Exam Score Calculator** - Allows users to input exam scores dynamically and calculates the total and average.
6. **Storing Infos Using Array** - Demonstrates storing and retrieving user information using arrays.
7. **Looping Different Shapes** - Prints different shapes using loops.
8. **Print 1 to N Without Loops** - Asks the user to print multiple sets of numbers from 1 to N without using loops.

**Technologies Used**
- C Programming Language
- GCC Compiler
- VS Code
